# customer-segmentation-classification

#### This dataset was from Kaggle: `https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaushiksuresh147/customer-segmentation`

### This project will consist with the following procedures
- EDA on every column (field)
    - Cross reference within columns
- Deal with outliers and missing values
- Find high correlations between columns
- Feature Engineering
- Feature Selection
- Base Model (Logisitic Regression)
- Non-linear Model Algorithms
- Tune the models
- Deep Dive in the best Model



## Side note
Things to do when more time
- see if 4 segments is the optimal number of splits
    - make the data into an unsupervised learning method and create a model that best splits them in k-clusters
